        The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low
        Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA
        (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The ownership and use of
        the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station serves as a
        microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in
        astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. The ISS is suited for testing the
        spacecraft systems and equipment required for possible future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.
